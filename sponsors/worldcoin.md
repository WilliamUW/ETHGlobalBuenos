World ID
World ID guarantees that each wallet corresponds to a real, verified human. This prevents duplicate or fake ReviewSync accounts and stops users from artificially inflating or selective exclusion of their cross-platform reputation. Every verified human can hold only one active ReviewSync identity, preserving trust and integrity in the system.
