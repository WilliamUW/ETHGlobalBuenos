Flare
We deployed the ReviewSync smart contract on the Flare testnet to store cross-platform review metadata. Flare’s data-optimized architecture lets us reliably anchor rating information on-chain. We also use Flare’s RNG to mint a randomized amount of ReviewSync tokens as rewards whenever users upload verified reputation data.
